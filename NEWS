### 0.7.2 (10 April 2015)

* The primary additions to this developmental change are the addition of 
  decision nodes.  Each node now has a new descriptor (found in 
  `network$nodeDecision`.  It is a logical value indicating if the node should
  be considered a decision node.
* The behavior of decision nodes is exactly like all other nodes in every 
  respect _until_ you call the `compileDecisionNetwork` function.  
  `compileDecisionNetwork` evaluates all of the decision nodes, builds a table
  of all combinations of decision options, and systematically runs
  `compileJagsModel` for each row of that table to create a JAGS model for 
  each combination of decisions.
* Decision nodes can be defined in `setNode`, but for convenience, a new 
  function is introduced (`setDecisionNodes`) to allow multiple nodes to be 
  defined as decision nodes in one call.  This is intended for use when a list
  of models is used to define a network.
* Various bugs have been corrected that were uncovered while testing conditional
  logic nodes (this is not a formal feature of HydeNet, but can be done.  A 
  vignette describing their use will be built later)
* Additional bugs have been corrected while uncovered during the testing of 
  decision node features.

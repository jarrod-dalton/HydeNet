Description: Facilities for easy implementation of hybrid Bayesian networks
    using R. Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs representing joint
    probability distributions, where each node represents a random
    variable and each edge represents conditionality. The full joint
    distribution is therefore factorized as a product of conditional densities, 
    where each node is assumed to be independent of its non-desendents given 
    information on its parent nodes. Since fast, closed-form algorithms 
    do not exist for hybrid networks that contain a combination of continuous
    and discrete nodes, particle-based approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo
    are popular.  We provide a user-friendly interface to constructing these 
    networks and running inference using rjags. Econometric analyses (maximum
    expected utility under competing policies, value of information) involving
    decision and utility nodes are supported.

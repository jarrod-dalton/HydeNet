Description: Facilities for easy implementation of hybrid Bayesian networks
    using R. Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs representing joint
    probability distributions, where each node represents a random variable and
    each edge represents conditionality. The full joint distribution is
    therefore factorized as a product of conditional densities, where each node
    is assumed to be independent of its non-desendents given information on its
    parent nodes. Since exact, closed-form algorithms are computationally
    burdensome for inference within hybrid networks that contain a combination
    of continuous and discrete nodes, particle-based approximation techniques
    like Markov Chain Monte Carlo are popular.  We provide a user-friendly
    interface to constructing these networks and running inference using rjags.
    Econometric analyses (maximum expected utility under competing policies,
    value of information) involving decision and utility nodes are also
    supported.

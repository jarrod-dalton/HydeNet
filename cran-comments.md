`check` on win-builder returns the NOTE:  

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:  
  acyclic (9:45)  
  conditionality (11:26)  

We believe these words to be spelled 
correctly and wish to overlook this note, if possible.



`check` on win-builder returns the NOTE:

No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped
